          <h3>Plastic Bottle (PET)</h3>
          <p>Discarded plastic bottles are containers made of plastic, commonly polyethylene terephthalate (PET), that have been disposed of and are no longer in use. When plastic bottles are improperly discarded, they contribute to the growing issue of plastic pollution, particularly in oceans, rivers, and landfills. Due to their slow decomposition rate, discarded plastic bottles can persist in the environment for hundreds of years, causing harm to wildlife, ecosystems, and human health.</p>

          <h3>Cardboard Box</h3>
          <p>Discarded cardboard boxes are boxes made from corrugated cardboard that have been discarded or no longer needed for their original purpose. These boxes are typically used for packaging and shipping various products but are often thrown away instead of being recycled or repurposed. When cardboard boxes are improperly discarded, they contribute to landfill waste and environmental degradation. However, when handled responsibly, cardboard boxes can be recycled, reducing the demand for new materials, and minimizing the environmental impact associated with their production.</p>

          <h3>Bubble Wrap</h3>
          <p>Discarded bubble wrap refers to the used or no longer needed sheets of plastic packaging material filled with air bubbles. Often used for protecting fragile items during shipping or storage, bubble wrap becomes waste when it is disposed of instead of being recycled or reused. When improperly discarded, bubble wrap contributes to plastic pollution and environmental harm. However, responsible disposal methods, such as recycling at designated drop-off points or reusing bubble wrap for future packaging needs, can help minimize its environmental impact and promote sustainability.</p>

          <h3>Medical Waste</h3>
          <p>Discarded medical waste refers to various materials generated from healthcare facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and laboratories, that are deemed no longer needed for their intended use and require specialized handling and disposal. This waste category encompasses items such as used needles, syringes, gloves, gauze, bandages, contaminated materials, pharmaceuticals, and other medical supplies. Proper management of discarded medical waste is critical to prevent the spread of infections, protect public health, and minimize environmental impact.</p>

          <h3>HVS Paper</h3>
          <p>Discarded HVS (High-Volume Printing System) paper refers to sheets of paper that are no longer needed or have completed their use in printing applications. HVS paper is commonly used in high-volume printing environments, such as offices, schools, and businesses. When HVS paper is discarded, it becomes waste and can contribute to landfill accumulation if not properly managed. However, responsible waste management practices, including recycling, can help divert HVS paper from landfills and reduce the environmental impact. Recycling HVS paper helps conserve resources, reduce energy consumption, and minimize the need for virgin paper production.</p>

          <h3>Photocard Inner Sleeve</h3>
          <p>Discarded photocard inner sleeves refer to the protective sleeves made of plastic or paper that are often found inside music album packaging or collector's edition photo albums. These sleeves are designed to protect and preserve photocard inserts that feature artist photos or collectible cards. When these inner sleeves are no longer needed or damaged, they can become waste if not properly managed. It is essential to responsibly dispose of or recycle these inner sleeves to minimize their environmental impact.</p>
